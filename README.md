# Penetration Testing vs. Red Teaming

## Overview
This document outlines the key differences between penetration testing and red team engagements.

| Penetration Testing | Red Teaming |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Time-boxed for a short period | Extended time frame |
| Uses commercial penetration testing tools | Encourages creative approaches using any available tools |
| Target organization is aware of the test | Target organization is usually unaware |
| Focuses on exploiting known vulnerabilities | Aims to discover unknown vulnerabilities |
| Scope and targets are predefined | Scope can be fluid and span multiple domains |
| Systems tested independently | Systems tested simultaneously |

## Summary
- **Penetration Testing** evaluates systems against known vulnerabilities within a fixed scope and timeframe.  
- **Red Teaming** simulates realistic adversary behavior, testing detection, response, and resilience over a broader and more flexible scope.
